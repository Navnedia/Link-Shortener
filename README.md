# Link Shortener

> **Warning** work in progress!

A simple open-source and self-hosted link shortener built for personal use, and to explore new technologies. This link shortener allows users to create, edit, and manage their short links from an online dashboard to make sharing content link easier. 

The goal of this project was to learn more about building restful APIs, using databases, and building projects that connect a frontend and backend. I built this project using NodeJS with Typescript, express for API routing, mongooDB as a database, and vanilla html, css, and javascript for the frontend web interface. I'm also finishing up adding user athentication with google so I can deploy an official working demo very soon.

**ToDo:**
- [ ] Finish user authentication
- [ ] Deploy active demo
- [ ] Finish comprehensive documentation!
- [ ] Add API Tokens to allow external applications to call the API
- [ ] Add QR Codes
- [ ] Add additional setting for shortlink customization

Stay tuned :)
