# Link Shortener

> **Warning** work in progress!

A simple simple open source link shortener built for fun and practice. This link shortener allows user to create, edit, and manage there short links from an online dashboard to make sharing content link easier. 

The goal of this project was to learn more about building restful APIs, using databases, and building projects that connect a frontend and backend. I built this project using NodeJS with Typescript, express for API routing, mongooDB as a database, and vanilla html, css, and javascript for the frontend web interface. I'm also finishing up adding user athentication with google so I can deploy an official working demo very soon.

**ToDo:**
- [ ] Finish user authentication
- [ ] Deploy active demo
- [ ] Finish comprehensive documentation!
- [ ] Add API Tokens to allow external applications to call the API

Stay tuned :)
