# Mini Link

> **Warning** work in progress!

A simple open-source and self-hosted URL shortener to make sharing easy! Built for personal use, and to explore new technologies. This URL shortener allows users to create, edit, and manage their short links from an online dashboard to make sharing content link easier. 

Check out the live application at: **[minil.app](https://minil.app)**

The goal of this project was to learn more about building restful APIs, using databases, and building projects that connect a front end and a back end. I built this project using NodeJS with Typescript, express for API routing, MongoDB as a database, and vanilla HTML, CSS, and javascript for the front-end web interface.

**ToDo:**
- [x] Finish user authentication
- [x] Deploy active demo
- [ ] Finish comprehensive documentation!
- [ ] Add API Tokens to allow external applications to call the API
- [ ] Add QR Codes
- [ ] Add additional setting for short link customization

Stay tuned :)
